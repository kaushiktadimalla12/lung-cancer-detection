Lung Cancer Detection System
Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the most serious health problems worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve survival rates. However, analyzing medical images manually is time-consuming and may lead to errors. This project focuses on building an automated system that helps detect lung cancer using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Project Overview

This project is a Lung Cancer Detection System that uses a trained deep learning model to analyze medical imaging data and predict the presence of lung cancer. The system is designed with a clear separation between backend processing and frontend user interaction.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be integrated with a web application to provide an end-to-end solution.

How the System Works

The user interacts with the web interface (frontend).

Input data is sent to the backend API.

The backend loads the trained model and performs inference.

The prediction result is sent back to the frontend.

The result is displayed to the user in a clear and understandable format.

Technologies Used
Backend

Python

PyTorch

NumPy and Pandas

API framework (Flask / FastAPI)

Frontend

React.js

Vite

Tailwind CSS

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Other Tools

Git and GitHub
Model Information

The trained model used for lung cancer detection is included in the repository for easy evaluation and testing. Since the model is finalized, future changes to the project mainly focus on improving the user interface and backend functionality.

Purpose of the Project

Academic and learning purposes

Understanding the integration of machine learning with web applications

Demonstrating end-to-end project development

⚠️ This system is not intended for real-world medical diagnosis.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to assist in lung cancer detection by combining a trained model with a web-based interface. It highlights the practical application of AI in healthcare while maintaining a clear and modular project structure.
